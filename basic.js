//How to fill up an H1 tag with jsüëáüèº
//first you have to chose an ID for your h1 tag and then write this in the js file
document.getElementById("myH1").textContent = 'hello';

//to find a type of something we use the method (typeof)

// variable = A container that stores a value

// First declaration    let x;
// Second assignment    x = 100;

//Strings can contain numbers

//They are either true or false
