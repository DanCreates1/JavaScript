//This file contains the basics of JavaScript


//How to fill up an H1 tag with js👇🏼
//first you have to chose an ID for your h1 tag and then write this in the js file
document.getElementById("myH1").textContent = 'hello';

//to find a type of something we use the method (typeof)
let price = 100
console.log(typeof price);



// variable = A container that stores a value

// First declaration    let x;
// Second assignment    x = 100;

let x;
x = 200;

console.log(x);


//let age = 25;
//let price = 100

//console.log(`You are ${age} years old`);
//console.log(`The price is $${price}`)



//STRINGS
//Strings can contain numbers
let firstName = "Pouyan";
let favoriteFood =  "pizza"
let email = "pouayn123@gmail.com";

console.log(typeof firstName);
console.log(`your name is ${firstName}`);
console.log(`you like ${favoriteFood}`);
console.log(`your email is ${email}`);



//Booleans
//They are either true or false

let online = true;
let forSale = true;
let isStudent = false;


console.log(typeof online);
console.log(`pouyan is online: ${online}`);
console.log(`Is this house for sale: ${forSale}`);
console.log(`Enrolled: ${isStudent}`)




//arithmetic operators = values, variables, etc
// + - * /
//example 11 = x + 8


//let students = 30;

//students = students + 1;    //PLUS
//students = students - 1;    //minus 
//students = students * 2;    //times
//students = students / 2;    //division
//students = students ** 2;   //to the power
//let extraStudent = students % 3;   


//students += 1;
//students -= 1;
//students *= 2;
//students /= 2;
//students **= 2;
//students %= 2;

//students++;
//students--;


//console.log(students);


//CONST = a variable that can't be changed
//you just need this p element in your html file <p id="p1"><p1>
